To start a chat between two clients:

1. Create 2 accounts using the sign up buton on the login screen
2. login to an account, offcourse you can also log into to both. 
3. Add one of the accounts a contact, you do this from the contact tab and pressing the little meeple with the plus sign. 
4. start a conversation with the other account. you do this from the left most tab 
with the cloud plus button in the left bottem corner.
5. unfortunatly for the reciepient to see the chat you will have to close down and open up the chat, 
once the conversaton has been added both can chat normally.
